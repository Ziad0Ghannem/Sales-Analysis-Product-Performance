# 📊 Sales Analysis & Product Performance

This project analyzes real sales data to uncover product trends, customer behavior, and sales performance over time. It started from a raw backup dataset with minimal documentation, and through exploration and data wrangling, meaningful insights were extracted.

## 🔁 Process Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration
- Reviewed and understood two core tables:
  - `Sales`: product codes, prices, quantities, timestamps.
  - `Products`: product names & IDs.
- Mapped the relationships manually due to lack of documentation.

### 2️⃣ Cleaning & Transformation
- Merged product info into sales table via product ID.
- Handled invalid dates (e.g., entries from the year 2027) by shifting all future dates back by 4 years.
- Created a `total_price` column from `qty * price`.

### 3️⃣ Functional Highlights
- Custom functions to:
  - Calculate total sales over time.
  - Extract product quantities based on a specific date.
- Outputs saved as `.xlsx` reports for business use.
